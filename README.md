Repo for my Recipes website

This project aims to demonstrate my basic understanding of core html features.
It will require the use of: Headers, Links, Images, and Lists (unordered and ordered).
I will eventually return to make this prettier after developing a practical understanding of CSS.
In the meantime, please enjoy my brutalist Recipes website.
